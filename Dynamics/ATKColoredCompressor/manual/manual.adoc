== Usage

Here is how the parameters interact with the plugin:

[square]
* *RMS* changes the size of the window-like RMS computation. A value of 0 gives peak measurement.
* *Attack* handles the speed at which the attack-release filter increases its detected value
* *Release* handles the speed at which the attack-release filter decreases its detected value
* *Threshold* modifies the threshold from which the compressor starts acting
* *Ratio* modifies the slope of the compression curve. The higher the ratio, the more the compression.
* *Softness* is a comprise between soft knee and hard knee
* *Color* changes the behavior around the threshold. A positive color increases the gain above 1, a negative value decreases the gain.
* *Quality* handles the range around the threshold on which the color applies
* *Make-up* Allows to increase the compressor output volume
* *Dry/Wet* balances the amount of processed signal versus input signal
